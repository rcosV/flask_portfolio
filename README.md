# flask_portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and professional journey. It's built with Flask and is currently hosted on Vercel.

## Live Demo

You can view the live site at https://flask-portfolio-rcosvs-projects.vercel.app

## Features

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Dynamic content rendering using Flask.
- Contact form integration with backend processing.
    The portfolio website includes a contact form that allows visitors to send messages directly through the website. The backend processing for this form is set up to capture the submitted data and handle it appropriately.

    **Note**: While the contact form's backend processing is fully functional, it is not compatible with Vercel's serverless deployment directly from GitHub due to Vercel's immutable filesystem.
- Hosted on Vercel for high availability.
